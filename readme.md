# Flutter Scout printable remote control car

Scout is an experimental vehicle that can be printed by anyone with a 3D printer with at least 165mm of travel in one axis. The original Scout vehicles were printed on an Ultimaker, which is a highly recommended printer.

Scout does not use any screws. Sourcing screws is annoying and time consuming, and screwing things together is boring. Scout snaps together using interlocking parts and clips. The whole vehicle can be disassembled and reassembled in just a few minutes.

### Flaws

The current vehicle was designed quickly over a few weekends as a proof of concept, and so it has many flaws. A short list:
The right angle mounting of the motor creates a week point with the bevel gears.
The wheels are supposed to slip on, but using my printer they need to be hammered into place with a mallet.
The steering requires a piece of bent piano wire, and should be replaced with a printed linkage.
The body shell easily comes off, and so tape should be wrapped around the body of the system.
There is no hole in the body shell for a power switch, so without modification the tape needs to be cut to toggle power.
After agressive driving the motor gets hot and eventually wiggles in its mount.

Despite these flaws, the car is impressibly capable. It can even pull ten foot wheelies.


### Assembly notes

The wheels currently press on. If you cannot get them to fit, scale the wheel up by a few percent. You may have to glue them in the end. If they are loose, you may want to use super glue.

The rear axle should be 100% infill for strength. Everything else can generally be 20%-20% infill.

I mention using a Flutter radio to promote the product, but you can also use any normal remote control car radio, though steering may be backwards.

Any standard servo works. Other quadcopter motors should work with changes to the gear placement, but this motor is incredibly strong even with a 2s battery.
